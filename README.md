The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined how people interact and disseminate information on social media. Twitter, as a primary outlet for real-time discourse, became a vital platform for individuals to share knowledge, concerns and updates. This study explores community structure within COVID-19-related hashtags on Twitter to understand how public attention and discussion topics evolved during the pandemic. Using network and community detection techniques, we analyze daily trends in hashtags associated with COVID-19 from a dataset that captures affected case data, deaths and recoveries compiled by Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization. By examining hashtag patterns from January 2020 onward, our analysis reveals shifts in discussion themes—from early focus on “Wuhan” and “virus origin” to later trends in “vaccines” “quarantine” and “remote work” — illustrating the evolving public discourse and collective understanding of COVID-19. This study highlights the role of social media in shaping community dynamics during global crisis and provides insights into the spread of COVID-19-related information on Twitter.
